How to format the code?

Source files try to follow some basic rules. The default indentation
of XEmacs is nice and, please, break the brackets. Please use spaces
instead of tabs and do not write lines longer than 80 symbols. Try to
make as small as possible functions.

See the files [ch]pp-file-format to see how files should be organized.

Should I say it? Comment your code; add a doxygen compatible
comment for classes, members, methods and files.

Any external documentation describing a particular concept is welcome.

Julien.
