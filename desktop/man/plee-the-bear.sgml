    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>Plee the Bear is a 2D platform game like those we found on
    consoles in the beginning of the 90's. The basis of the scenario
    fit in few lines:</para>

    <para>Plee the Bear wakes up late one afternoon after dreaming of
    his earlier years, when he traveled across the world with his
    belle at his side. Craving an afternoon snack, he sticks his arm
    in a nearby honey pot &mdash; only to find it empty! Upon discovering
    that all the pots in his house are empty, Plee thinks of his
    mischievous son and swears, "I'm gonna find that boy and give him
    the wallop he deserves."</para>

    <para>Following honey drops left on the ground, Plee reaches the
    edge of the forest, and his adventure begins.</para>

    <para>The current version is a demo.</para>
